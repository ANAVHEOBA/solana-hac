Build position tracking and basic risk assessment
Develop natural language parsing for DeFi queries


Day 3: Develop risk models and anomaly detection
Implement simplified ML models for risk prediction
Create anomaly detection for protocol metrics
Build simulation capabilities for basic strategies
Day 4: Add MEV protection and tax optimization features
Implement MEV detection and protection strategies
Create tax impact calculation for transactions
Develop strategy recommendation engine
Day 5: Polish, test, and prepare demo
Refine prompt engineering for better Claude interactions
Create compelling demo scenarios
Prepare presentation highlighting unique value proposition


Technical Challenges & Solutions
Data Freshness: Use WebSocket connections to Solana RPC for real-time updates
API Rate Limits: Implement intelligent caching and request batching
ML Model Accuracy: Start with rule-based systems and enhance with simple ML models
User Privacy: Use zero-knowledge proofs or local computation for sensitive data
Prompt Engineering: Carefully design Claude prompts to handle complex DeFi concepts



First Steps for Building Solana DeFi Sentinel
For Day 1, you should focus on setting up the MCP server framework and establishing basic Solana data connections. Here's a detailed breakdown of your first tasks:
1. Set Up the MCP Server Framework
Create a new project repository
Initialize a Node.js/TypeScript project
Set up proper folder structure for an MCP server
2. Install core dependencies
Anthropic SDK for Claude integration
MCP framework libraries
Solana Agent Kit
Web3.js for Solana interactions


Configure the basic MCP server
Set up environment variables for API keys
Create the server entry point
Implement basic request handling
2. Establish Basic Solana Data Connections
Set up RPC connection
Configure connection to a reliable Solana RPC endpoint
Implement basic health checks and fallback mechanisms
Create data fetching utilities
Build functions to fetch account data
Implement transaction parsing
Create utilities for token balances and prices


Integrate with Helius API
Set up API key and connection
Create wrappers for common data queries
Implement webhook setup for real-time notifications
3. Design Initial Claude Prompts
Create prompt templates
Design system prompts that explain DeFi concepts to Claude
Create templates for different query types (portfolio analysis, risk assessment, etc.)
Implement prompt construction logic



Build basic tool definitions
Define the tools Claude can use
Create JSON schemas for tool inputs/outputs
Implement tool calling logic
4. Create a Simple Demo Flow
Implement a basic portfolio analysis flow
Accept a wallet address
